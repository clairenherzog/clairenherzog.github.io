  is itching to create. 
  She is a recent graduate of UC Santa Barbara with a major in 
  Film and Media Studies and a minor in Media, Art, and Technology. 
  She is currently honing her skills in web design and motion design 
  using TouchDesigner, Figma, and Adobe After Effects. She is also learning 
  the basics of coding with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with the goal of improving 
  her interactive, transdisciplinary art abilities. She is innately drawn to the
  spaces in between disciplines, selfhoods, and beliefs where she is convinced the 
  best ideas thrive. She is passionate about how these intersections both reflect 
  and inform the human condition, and this passion is the thread that connects 
  her creative journey so far.
