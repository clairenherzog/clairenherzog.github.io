      is itching to create. 
      She is a recent graduate of UC Santa Barbara with a major in 
      Film and Media Studies and a minor in Media, Art, and Technology. 
      She is currently honing her skills in web design and motion design 
      using TouchDesigner, Figma, and Adobe After Effects. She is also learning 
      the basics of coding with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with the goal of improving 
      her interactive, transdisciplinary art abilities. She is innately drawn to the
      spaces in between disciplines, selfhoods, and beliefs where she is convinced the 
      best ideas thrive. She is passionate about how these intersections both reflect 
      and inform the human condition, and this passion is the thread that connects 
      her creative journey so far.
