      <h2>enter the void</h2>
      <p>Nietzsche once said, "...if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you." 
        So it is that this voidal structure gazes into the deepest fibers of your being. 
        How would you describe it? Rippling, expansive, particle-rich? Adaptive, detailed, grainy, ambiguous? 
        Each word that comes to your mind is a reflection of your assumptions, your intuitions, your perceptions of the world and yourself. 
        So do you gaze at the void, or does the void gaze into you?

    </h3>
  <p>A colorful blob--inspired by my love of blob-like structures. 
    Inspired by that unrelenting need to curl up in a ball and never come out. 
    Yet the blob dances. 
    It gives you hope. If a blob can dance, and be colorful at that, why can't you?
