      <h2>enter the void</h2>
      <p>Nietzsche once said, "...if you gaze for long 
        into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you." 
        So it is that this voidal structure gazes into
        the deepest fibers of your being. 
        How would you describe it? Rippling, 
        expansive, particle-rich? Adaptive, detailed, grainy, ambiguous? 
        Each word that comes to your mind is a reflection of your assumptions,
        your intuitions, your perceptions of the world and yourself. 
        So do you gaze at the void, or does the void gaze into you?

  <h2>my colorful blob</h2>

      <a href="https://newart.city/show/morph-narratives-in-transformation">featured here</a>>
    </h3>
  <p>A colorful blob--inspired by 
    my love of blob-like structures. 
    Inspired by that unrelenting need
    to curl up in a ball and never come out. 
    Yet the blob dances. 
    It gives you hope. If a blob can dance, 
    and be colorful at that, why can't you?

     <p>I and several other student designer sought to 
     make an app that addresses
     the inefficiencies of algorithmic recommendations 
     by music apps such as Spotify and Apple Music. 
     Ever struggled to find music that succinctly matches your mood? 
     Though Spotify and Apple music provide personalized recommendations, 
     our music mood matcher mobile app will employ an algorithmic recommendation 
     system based on detailed mood tracking and user feedback to learn your personal
     moods and music tastes. Check out the interactive prototype above!
